# Ship — working tree to green PR, one command

Orchestrate the kit's other skills in order. This skill only owns **sequencing, gates,
state, and the final report** — never re-implement a stage's logic inline.

## How to invoke each stage (portability)

Every stage names a skill **bundled in this kit** (`simplify`, `verify`, `code-review`,
`smart-commit`, `babysit`, `reflect`). Run each by whatever mechanism your agent provides:

- **If your harness has a skill-invocation tool** (e.g. Claude Code's `Skill` tool), call
  the named skill with it.
- **Otherwise**, load that skill's `SKILL.md` from this kit and follow its procedure
  directly — the bundled skills are written to be executed by reading them.

Either way: invoke the **exact skill named**, and don't substitute a similarly-named
subagent or generic tool for it.

**For `simplify`, `verify`, and `code-review` specifically: prefer your harness's native
or built-in skill of that name if it has one** (it's usually richer — e.g. a cloud
multi-agent reviewer), and fall back to this kit's bundled copy only where the harness
provides none. The bundled copies exist so the pipeline runs *everywhere*, not just where
those skills are pre-installed.

## Flags (parse from the arguments)

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--fast` | Skip Stage 1 (simplify) and Stage 3 (code-review) — for tiny changes |
| `--merge` | Squash-merge once green (default: stop at green, human merges) |
| `--no-verify` | Skip Stage 2b (runtime verify) — docs/config-only changes. The Stage 2a rebase check still runs |
| `--yolo` | Hands-off: auto-confirm the Stage 6 checkpoint and resolve any mid-pipeline ambiguity autonomously (operates under the bundled `yolo` skill's rules) instead of pausing. Stops at green — does **not** merge; merge stays `--merge` |

## Cross-cutting rules

- **Fail loud, never skip silently.** A stage that fails HALTS the pipeline with the
  evidence. A stage skipped by flag must be named as "skipped (--flag)" in the final
  summary. Never report "shipped" if anything was silently skipped.
- **Always simplify + review the full change being shipped.** Stages 1 (simplify) and 3
  (code-review) run on *every* ship — regardless of whether the work is already committed
  or a PR is already open. `--fast` is the **only** way to skip them. "The change being
  shipped" = uncommitted working-tree edits **plus** any already-committed-but-unmerged
  work (`git diff <base>...HEAD`), not just what's currently uncommitted — so your code
  gets simplified and reviewed even after you've committed or opened the PR. Any fixes
  they produce are committed (Stage 4) and pushed (Stage 7) like any other work.
- **Project conventions override this recipe.** A repo's own instruction file
  (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.) wins. Examples: a project that forbids a tracked
  CHANGELOG.md (skip smart-commit's changelog step there); a project whose tests run in a
  specific environment (CI, a container, a remote host) rather than locally; a
  project-specific verify/test recipe always beats the generic one.
- **State file** `.ship-state.json` (repo-local): write
  `{branch, head_sha, flags, completed_stages: []}` after each stage; on invocation, if it
  exists and `branch` matches the current branch, offer to resume from the next stage;
  delete it on success.

## Stage 0 — Preflight

1. Parse flags. Read state file → offer resume if it matches the current branch (under
   `--yolo`, resume automatically — don't ask).
2. `git status` + check for unshipped commits + `gh pr view --json url,state 2>/dev/null`.
   Detect unshipped commits robustly: `git log @{u}.. 2>/dev/null` works only when an upstream
   is set — a branch that has never been pushed has no `@{u}`, so that command errors and a bare
   `2>/dev/null` makes it look falsely "empty" (= nothing to ship). When there is no upstream,
   fall back to `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline` so brand-new local commits still count. If the
   tree is clean, there are no unshipped commits, AND no open PR exists for this branch → say
   "nothing to ship" and stop.
3. **PR already open for this branch:** an open PR does NOT skip the quality stages —
   "pushed" is not "polished", and a local review pass is cheaper than a remote review
   round-trip (push + CI + re-review). Adjust as follows:
   - **Run stages 1–4 against the PR's full diff vs base** (`git diff origin/<base>...HEAD`),
     not just the working tree — regardless of the PR's current approval state. If they
     produce fixes, commit (Stage 4) and continue; if they produce nothing, say so and
     continue.
   - **Even when the PR is already APPROVED + CI green + mergeable, still run them** (the
     always-simplify+review policy applies here too). ⚠️ Pushing the resulting fixes
     re-triggers CI and a fresh review, which can flip the existing approval — that's the
     accepted trade-off, not a surprise. Make it explicit in the Stage 6 checkpoint summary
     so the push is a deliberate choice; the Stage 6 gate (unless `--merge`) is the user's
     last chance to decline burning the green.
   - **Stage 5 is N/A**: never rename a branch with an open PR — deleting/repushing the
     remote ref closes the PR.
   - **Rebase (Stage 2a) becomes report-only**: report how far behind base the branch is,
     but don't rebase — once a PR is under review, babysit owns the decision of when an
     update-with-base is worth a re-review cycle.
   - **Stage 6/7**: the checkpoint gates pushing new fix commits to the existing PR
     (instead of "open PR?"); `--merge` authorizes it as usual. Stage 7 is just `git push`
     — no PR creation.
   - The final summary must still list every stage as run / produced-nothing / N-A with the
     reason — never silently omit them.
4. **Branch safety:** if on `main`/`master` with uncommitted work, create a working branch
   NOW (`git checkout -b wip/ship-<short-desc>`) before any stage mutates files. The final
   name is fixed in Stage 5 — don't bikeshed it here.
5. **Base branch:** resolve the branch this change targets. If a worktree/host tool records
   it (e.g. a `target_branch` field), read it from there; otherwise use the repo default
   (`git remote show origin` / `origin/HEAD`). Record it for Stage 7. (The fast-path needs
   this too — resolve it before the behind-base check.)

## Stage 1 — Simplify (skip if --fast)

Run the `simplify` skill on the **full change being shipped** (see *Always simplify +
review* — working-tree edits plus already-committed-but-unmerged work,
`git diff <base>...HEAD`, not just uncommitted). It applies quality cleanups to those
files; if the change was already fully committed, its edits land in the working tree and
are picked up by Stage 4.

## Stage 2 — Verify (skip if --no-verify)

**2a. Rebase check (runs even with --no-verify):** verification against a stale base is
worthless, so first check whether the branch should rebase onto the Stage 0 base branch:

```bash
git fetch origin <base>
git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/<base>            # commits we're behind
git diff --name-only HEAD...origin/<base>           # files base changed since we diverged
```

- Behind 0 commits → no rebase, continue.
- Behind, and base touched **any file this branch also touches** (compare against
  `git diff --name-only <merge-base> HEAD` + working-tree changes) → **rebase now**
  (`git stash` if dirty → `git rebase origin/<base>` → `git stash pop`). Overlap means the
  verify result would be a lie without it.
- Behind on disjoint files only → rebase anyway if it's cheap and clean (default), but a
  conflict here is not worth fighting pre-PR — abort the rebase and continue, noting
  "N commits behind base, disjoint, rebase deferred" in the Stage 6 summary.
- **Rebase conflict on overlapping files → STOP** (fail loud): abort the rebase, report
  the conflicting files, and ask the user how to resolve. Never auto-resolve conflicts in
  shipped code.

**2b. Verify:** run the `verify` skill: run the app/tests and observe the change actually
working (post-rebase, if one happened).
**Gate:** if verification fails → STOP. Report exactly what failed and why the pipeline
halted. Do not continue to review or commit broken work.

## Stage 3 — Code review (skip if --fast)

Run the `code-review` skill with `--fix`, reviewing the **full change being shipped** (the
diff vs base, per *Always simplify + review*) — so already-committed code is reviewed too,
not just uncommitted edits. There's no effort knob: `code-review` gets its thoroughness by
fanning out across parallel sub-agents (scaled to the diff), then adversarially verifying
each finding — so the depth is automatic.

`--fix` is essential here: it *applies* the findings to the working tree so Stage 3 can
re-verify and Stage 4 can commit them. A review that only reports (no fix) does not satisfy
this stage. (On Claude Code, prefer the built-in `code-review` skill, which has `--fix` and
a cloud `ultra` mode; elsewhere the bundled `code-review` covers it.) In particular, do
**not** dispatch a report-only review *agent* in place of this skill — e.g. on Claude Code
the `pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer` / `silent-failure-hunter` agents *report* findings but
never apply them, so using one here leaves the findings unfixed and Stage 4 commits
un-reviewed-fixed code.

If it applied fixes AND Stage 2b (verify) ran: re-run the cheap verification (tests, not
the full app walk) so review fixes are never committed unverified. Same gate as Stage 2.
(Under `--no-verify`, Stage 2b was skipped, so there's nothing to re-run — the always-on
2a rebase check does not count as verification here.)

## Stage 4 — Commit

Run the `smart-commit` skill to cluster and commit with conventional messages.
Honor project conventions: where a tracked CHANGELOG is forbidden, tell smart-commit to
skip its changelog step.

## Stage 5 — Branch naming

The branch must match `<type>/<kebab-slug>` where `<type>` ∈ {feat, fix, docs, chore,
refactor, test, perf} — derive it from the dominant conventional-commit type of the commits
being shipped; slug = short kebab-case summary of the change.

- Non-conforming (wip/ placeholder, personal prefix, etc.) → `git branch -m <type>/<slug>`
  BEFORE pushing.
- Already pushed under the old name → push the new name, then after the PR is open delete
  the old remote ref (`git push origin :<old-name>`).
- Already conforming → leave it alone.

## Stage 6 — CHECKPOINT (the one pause)

Present a compact summary: stages run (and skipped, with flags), verification evidence,
review findings fixed, commit list, final branch name, drafted PR title + body.

Then **ask the user once, in plain text, to confirm: proceed to push + open PR?** Wait for
their reply. (If your harness has a structured multiple-choice prompt, you may use it; if
not, a plain "proceed? (yes/no)" in chat is the portable form. Either way — wait for an
answer; don't assume one.) This is the only outward-facing gate. Authorization rules:

- `--merge` on the invocation **is** standing authorization for all outward-facing steps
  (push, PR, merge) — do not re-ask at the checkpoint. The user opted into hands-off
  end-to-end by passing it.
- `--yolo` auto-confirms this checkpoint (hands-off through push + PR + babysit-to-green) —
  don't re-ask. It does **not** authorize merge: that stays `--merge`. So `--yolo` alone
  stops at green; `--yolo --merge` runs fully hands-off including the squash-merge. (The one
  thing `--yolo` does not silence is Stage 10 `reflect`, which never auto-writes — on a
  hands-off run it *surfaces* its suggestions without blocking; see Stage 10.)
- With a PR already open: the checkpoint gates pushing new fix commits to it (a push
  re-triggers CI + QA review). If the quality stages produced nothing, there's nothing to
  gate — record the checkpoint as N/A.
- Without `--merge` or `--yolo`, and with new work to push: the checkpoint question is
  mandatory. If running non-interactively (headless, or under an unattended loop), stop here
  and report "staged and waiting" rather than guessing.

## Stage 7 — Push + PR

1. `git push -u origin <branch>`.
2. `gh pr create` against the Stage 0 base branch. Body: what changed, why, how it was
   verified (cite the Stage 2 evidence). PR title must be conventional-format (some repos
   gate on it with a `pr-title` check). End the body with your standard attribution footer.

## Stage 8 — Babysit to green

Run the `babysit` skill to drive the PR to the goal (fresh APPROVED + all CI green +
mergeable). The Stage 6 checkpoint already authorized hands-off continuation — don't ask
again.

**Looping until the goal:** babysit does one check-react pass per run and defines the goal
itself. To loop it until green, use whatever recurring mechanism your harness offers (e.g.
Claude Code's `loop` skill; a cron/scheduled-automation primitive; or simply re-running
babysit yourself each cycle). If your harness has no loop primitive, iterate in-session:
run a pass, wait for CI/review to land, run the next — until babysit reports the goal met
or you're genuinely blocked on a human reviewer.

If the user wants a single status pass instead of the full loop, run `babysit` once.

## Stage 9 — End state

- **Default:** report "PR #N is green and mergeable: <url>" and STOP. A human merges.
- **--merge:** `gh pr merge <PR#> --squash --delete-branch` once green, then report the
  merge.
- Delete `.ship-state.json`.
- Final summary must list every stage as run / skipped (--flag) / halted — no silent gaps.

## Stage 10 — Reflect (final step)

Run the `reflect` skill as the very last action, after the end-state report — so every ship
ends by capturing what the session taught (gotchas, new patterns, integration quirks) into
the knowledge base.

Reflect is safe to run on every ship: it **self-gates** (scans the session and early-exits
with "No new knowledge" when the work was routine) and **never auto-applies** — it proposes,
then waits for a plain reply (`ok`/`ko`) before writing anything. Under `--merge`, `--yolo`,
or any unattended/headless run there is no one to reply, so it only *surfaces* its suggestions
in the final report and does **not** block — it skips the save rather than waiting (it never
auto-writes, so nothing is lost but the optional capture). An interactive run still gets the
`ok`/`ko` prompt. Either way the pipeline completes — `reflect` never holds a hands-off run open.
